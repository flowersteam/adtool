    be inherited from by concrete implementations of `System`s.

    A `System` is a model for a dynamical or complex system. In the context
    of the experimental pipeline, it should be stateless and therefore a pure
    function. Therefore, while the system parameters may need to be set,
    these are in fact _hyperparameters_ set by the web interface, and not
    parameters which are explored by the curiosity algorithm.

    As a pure function, it takes a payload of data as input and returns an
    new payload of data as output, without mutating the input.

        A `System` operates on regular Python dicts, but it views them as

        the structured elements that the `System` operates on. Often, the
        `postmap_key` does not exist in the input dict, and is added by the
        `Map` as output.

        Whether or not the `premap_key` exists in the output dict is up to the
        implementation of the specific `System`. We recommend preserving it.
